NOTE October 2023: with each iteration of the SCF, the summary datasets for previous surveys (found here: https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scf-previous-surveys.htm) are adjusted so as to be in current dollars. E.g., as of October 2023, the 2019 survey (found here: https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scf_2019.htm) is in 2022 dollars. Consequently, if one wishes to use the above code to replicate all of the figures in the paper, one must adjust for inflation.
